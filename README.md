# TV shows search

## This simple application uses a free to use API from [TV MAZE](https://www.tvmaze.com/api).

Right now the application only supports searching using tv shows names and it will show all shows that matches the name or have their name similar to your key word that you searched with.

In the future I would like to add:
1. The ability to search by other methods: year of release, episode name, actors and so on.
1. The ability to search for Movies as well.
2. Perhaps a better UI/UX, I'm not so good at it :).
