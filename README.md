# TV shows search

# This simple application uses a free to use API from [TV MAZE](https://www.tvmaze.com/api).

## Using a tv show name or any keyword to search with, the application will show matching shows (if any) and their rating according to TV MAZE.

Right now the application only supports searching using tv shows names and it will show all shows that matches the name or have their name similar to your key word that you searched with.

In the future I would like to add:
1. The ability to search by other methods: year of release, episode name, actors and so on.
2. Show more information about the search results, right now it's only name/rating.
4. The ability to search for Movies as well.
5. Perhaps a better UI/UX, I'm not so good at it :)
